                        <h5>By JP Dustin</h5>
                        <p class="news-date">September 2, 2024</p>

                        <div class="image-container">

                            <div>Members of Teamsters Local 633 met to nominate candidates for the next 3 year term.
                                Standing at the lectern are Secretary-Treasurer Jeffrey Padellaro and President Jeff
                                Parkinson.</div>
                        </div>

                        <p>On September 1, 2024, Teamsters Local 633 held its official nomination meeting, where members
                            gathered to select candidates for the upcoming union election. Despite the meeting being
                            scheduled on Labor Day weekend, the event at Local 633 headquarters drew a solid turnout
                            from the membership, all eager to participate in this critical democratic process.</p>

                        <p>As members settled into their seats, a striking divide became evident in the hall. On one
                            side, supporters of the Members First Slate, clad in unified black t-shirts emblazoned with
                            their logo, sat together in a show of solidarity. Across the room, supporters of the Power
                            Slate, distinguished by their blue and gold shirts, occupied the opposite side. The meeting
                            commenced with an official welcome from Jeffrey Padellaro, Secretary-Treasurer of Local 633.
                            He addressed the members with a focus on the significance of the upcoming election,
                            emphasizing its impact on the union's future direction. Following Padellaro's remarks, Scott
                            Gove, Recording Secretary, took the floor to carefully read the bylaws related to the
                            election process, ensuring that all members were fully informed of the nomination rules and
                            setting a tone of transparency and fairness for the proceedings.</p>

                        <p>Nominations were then opened, overseen by a member from the International Brotherhood of
                            Teamsters. Candidates were each nominated and the nominations seconded by members in good
                            standing. Each candidate then accepted their nomination and had the opportunity to briefly
                            address the members, outlining their commitment to Local 633. Many candidates expressed
                            their dedication to strengthening the union, improving working conditions, and enhancing
                            member services.</p>

                        <p>
                            During the nominations, a surprising revelation came to light regarding the Power Slate's
                            candidate for vice president, Bob Browne. It was discovered that Browne was ineligible for
                            office due to an untimely dues payment while out on an injury. Replacing their original VP
                            pick is Bob Stanley, who was initially running for a Trustee position. Nathan Lafleur will
                            now be running for Trustee. To their credit, the Power Slate <a
                                href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/XCcvEYni4yKLxqeM/">acknowledged this issue</a> on
                            their Facebook page after the meeting, displaying a commitment to transparency even in the
                            face of setbacks.


                        </p>

                        <p>The Members First Slate, the incumbents, exuded a sense of unity and strength, speaking with
                            confidence and authority as they accepted their nominations. Their cohesive front was
                            evident as they sat together throughout the meeting, reinforcing their solidarity. In
                            contrast, the Power Slate candidates, whose speeches were sometimes difficult to hear, were
                            scattered throughout the room, blending in with the general membership. While this may have
                            appeared less unified, it could strategically convey that they are not above the members but
                            rather of the members, for the members.</p>

                        <p>The nominated candidates will now enter the campaign phase, where they will engage with
                            members and share their platforms. The Power Slate began their campaign efforts back in
                            July, but they have faced some resistance, particularly from the incumbents within the union
                            hall. <a href="https://www.633power.org/" target="_blank">According to their website</a>,
                            the Power Slate alleges they encountered hostility from certain employers during visits,
                            were instructed by a
                            manager—who was directed by a business agent of the local—that they could not be on specific
                            properties, and even met resistance in person at another site, where a significant number of
                            the current leadership were present.</p>

                        <p>In response to the Power Slate's claims, the Members First Slate issued a letter on their <a
                                href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61561214596567" target="_blank">Facebook
                                page</a>, denouncing the Power Slate and alleging they have been falsely presenting
                            themselves as representatives of Local 633. The letter went further, describing the Power
                            Slate members as "malcontents" with a "greedy agenda" and accused them of spreading false
                            information. The Members First Slate criticized the Power Slate for lacking diversity,
                            failing to negotiate any contracts, and for their overall inexperience, questioning their
                            ability to represent the union effectively. As the campaign intensifies, ballots should be
                            mailed out on or around September 23, 2024. Ballots must be received by 8:00 a.m. on October
                            17, 2024 to be counted. Members who do not receive a ballot by October 1, 2024 should
                            contact the Local 633 Union Hall. All members strongly encouraged to cast their votes and
                            make their voices heard.</p>

                        <p>This election is a pivotal moment for Local 633, as the outcome will determine the leadership
                            team that will guide the union through the next three-year term. The Members First Slate is
                            campaigning on a platform of experience and substantial membership growth, emphasizing their
                            track record and continuity. In contrast, the 633 Teamsters Power Slate is running on a
                            platform of strong advocacy, transparency, and proactive representation, aiming to
                            invigorate the union with a fresh approach. Members are urged to stay informed, participate
                            in upcoming events, and exercise their right to vote in this crucial election.</p>
