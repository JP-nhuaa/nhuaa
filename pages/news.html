                <article>

                    <p>On September 1, 2024, Teamsters Local 633 held its official nomination meeting, where members
                        gathered to select candidates for the upcoming union election. Despite the meeting being
                        scheduled on Labor Day weekend, the event at Local 633 headquarters drew a solid turnout
                        from the membership, all eager to participate in this critical democratic process.</p>

                    <p>As members settled into their seats, a striking divide became evident in the hall. On one
                        side, supporters of the Members First Slate, clad in unified black t-shirts emblazoned with
                        their logo, sat together in a show of solidarity. Across the room, supporters of the Power
                        Slate, distinguished by their blue and gold shirts, occupied the opposite side. The meeting
                        commenced with an official welcome from Jeffrey Padellaro, Secretary-Treasurer of Local 633.
                        He addressed the members with a focus on the significance of the upcoming election,
                        emphasizing its impact on the union's future direction. Following Padellaro's remarks, Scott
                        Gove, Recording Secretary, took the floor to carefully read the bylaws related to the
                        election process, ensuring that all members were fully informed of the nomination rules and
                        setting a tone of transparency and fairness for the proceedings.</p>

                    <p>Nominations were then opened, overseen by a member from the International Brotherhood of
                        Teamsters. Candidates were each nominated and the nominations seconded by members in good
                        standing. Each candidate then accepted their nomination and had the opportunity to briefly
                        address the members, outlining their commitment to Local 633. Many candidates expressed
                        their dedication to strengthening the union, improving working conditions, and enhancing
                        member services.</p>

                    <p>
                        During the nominations, a surprising change occurred regarding the Power Slate's candidate
                        for vice president. Those who had been following the Power Slate over the last several
                        months expected Bob Browne's name to be called for the VP nomination. However, instead of
                        Browne, Bob Stanley was nominated for vice president. Stanley had originally been running
                        for a Trustee position, and in his place, Nathan LaFleur was nominated for Trustee. To their
                        credit, the Power Slate later <a
                            href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/XCcvEYni4yKLxqeM/">acknowledged on
                            their Facebook
                            page</a> that Browne was ineligible
                        for office due to an untimely dues payment while he was out on injury, demonstrating a
                        commitment to transparency even in the face of setbacks.
                    </p>

                    <p>Throughout the meeting, the Members First Slate, the incumbents, exuded a sense of unity and
                        strength, speaking with
                        confidence and authority as they accepted their nominations. Their cohesive front was
                        evident as they sat together throughout the meeting, reinforcing their solidarity. In
                        contrast, the Power Slate candidates, whose speeches were sometimes difficult to hear, were
                        scattered throughout the room, blending in with the general membership. While this may have
                        appeared less unified, it could strategically convey that they are not above the members but
                        rather of the members, for the members.</p>

                    <p>The nominated candidates will now enter the campaign phase, where they will engage with
                        members and share their platforms. The Power Slate began their campaign efforts back in
                        July, but they have faced some resistance, particularly from the incumbents within the union
                        hall. <a href="https://www.633power.org/" target="_blank">According to their website</a>,
                        the Power Slate alleges they encountered hostility from certain employers during visits,
                        were instructed by a
                        manager—who was directed by a business agent of the local—that they could not be on specific
                        properties, and even met resistance in person at another site, where a significant number of
                        the current leadership were present.</p>

                    <p>In response to the Power Slate's claims, the Members First Slate issued a letter on their <a
                            href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61561214596567" target="_blank">Facebook
                            page</a>, denouncing the Power Slate and alleging they have been falsely presenting
                        themselves as representatives of Local 633. The letter went further, describing the Power
                        Slate members as "malcontents" with a "greedy agenda" and accused them of spreading false
                        information. The Members First Slate criticized the Power Slate for lacking diversity,
                        failing to negotiate any contracts, and for their overall inexperience, questioning their
                        ability to represent the union effectively.</p>
                    <p>
                        As the campaign intensifies, ballots should be
                        mailed out on or around September 23, 2024. Ballots must be received by 8:00 a.m. on October
                        17, 2024 to be counted. Members who do not receive a ballot by October 1, 2024 should
                        contact the Local 633 Union Hall.
                        All members strongly encouraged to cast their votes and
                        make their voices heard.</p>

                    <p>This election is a pivotal moment for Local 633, as the outcome will determine the leadership
                        team that will guide the union through the next three-year term. The Members First Slate is
                        campaigning on a platform of experience and substantial membership growth, emphasizing their
                        track record and continuity. In contrast, the 633 Teamsters Power Slate is running on a
                        platform of strong advocacy, transparency, and proactive representation, aiming to
                        invigorate the union with a fresh approach. Members are urged to stay informed, participate
                        in upcoming events, and exercise their right to vote in this crucial election.</p>
