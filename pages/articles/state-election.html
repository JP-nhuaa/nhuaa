                        In New Hampshire, where "right-to-work" legislation has been a recurring debate, it is crucial
                        for voters who care about the strength of their unions to stay informed about each candidateâ€™s
                        stance on labor rights. New Hampshire has seen multiple attempts to pass "right-to-work" laws,
                        which would prevent unions from requiring workers to pay union dues as a condition of
                        employment. This is part of a larger national push that many see as an effort to weaken
                        organized labor. In fact, states that have passed "right-to-work" laws often see lower wages and
                        reduced benefits for workers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Will your candidate support collective bargaining, fair wages, and worker protections? These key
                        issues are critical for preserving workers' rights in New Hampshire, a state where union density
                        has helped secure better working conditions for thousands. According to the Bureau of Labor
                        Statistics, union members in New Hampshire earn on average 11% more than their non-union
                        counterparts, underscoring the importance of protecting the right to organize.

                        most recent "right-to-work" bill in NH. HB1377 died in chamber when members of the House voted
                        to indefinitely postpone taking up the bill for the session. The bill was killed in a 212-168
                        vote, largely along party lines, with many arguing that it would have undermined collective
                        bargaining and weakened unions across the state.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is just the most recent in a long series of attempts to pass such a state law. Similar
                        bills
                        have been proposed and defeated several times in the past decade, each time drawing sharp lines
                        between labor advocates and those supporting the "right-to-work" agenda. New Hampshire remains
                        one of the few states in the region without a "right-to-work" law, a status that labor unions
                        have fought hard to maintain.

                        Your vote in the general election on November 5, 2024, will determine the policies that directly
                        affect unions and working people in New Hampshire. Make sure your voice is heard in this crucial
                        election.
